III. DETAILED RISK ANALYSIS

A. Market Risk
- The company’s exposure to foreign exchange differences is limited ($300,000, 4% of net profit), but international operations could increase volatility if not hedged.
- Receivables at 18% of revenue may indicate reliance on a few large customers, increasing vulnerability to demand shocks or credit events.
- The consumer goods sector is generally resilient but can be affected by macroeconomic downturns.

B. Credit Risk
- Receivables turnover (67 days) is within industry norms but should be monitored for deterioration.
- No evidence of significant bad debts or write-offs, but lack of customer concentration disclosure is a gap.

C. Liquidity Risk
- The company’s liquidity position is robust, with cash and equivalents covering all short-term borrowings and a current ratio well above 2.0.
- No signs of liquidity stress; operating cash flow covers 80% of current liabilities.

D. Solvency/Leverage Risk
- Debt levels are conservative, with long-term borrowings structured to avoid refinancing risk.
- Interest coverage is strong, indicating low risk of financial distress from debt service.

E. Operational Risk
- Inventory levels are reasonable, but the risk of obsolescence or overstocking exists in fast-moving consumer goods.
- High capital intensity requires ongoing investment and maintenance; underutilized assets could depress returns.
- Working capital increases (receivables, inventory) should be managed to avoid cash flow constraints.

F. Taxation/Regulatory Risk
- Tax rate is in line with expectations; no evidence of disputes.
- Compliance with IFRS and clean audit opinion reduce regulatory risk.

G. Strategic/Business Risk
- Asset turnover is moderate; management should review asset utilization.
- Absence of segment reporting and forward-looking guidance limits transparency and strategic risk assessment.

IV. MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Market Risk
- Diversify customer base to reduce concentration risk.
- Implement or review foreign exchange hedging policies for international operations.
- Monitor macroeconomic indicators and adjust production/inventory accordingly.

B. Credit Risk
- Strengthen credit assessment and monitoring of major customers.
- Regularly review receivables aging and enforce collection policies.
- Consider credit insurance for large or international customers.

C. Liquidity Risk
- Maintain current liquidity buffers.
- Regularly stress-test cash flow projections under adverse scenarios.
- Establish committed credit lines for contingency funding.

D. Solvency/Leverage Risk
- Continue conservative leverage policy.
- Monitor interest rate environment and consider fixing rates on long-term debt.
- Periodically review capital structure for optimal balance between debt and equity.

E. Operational Risk
- Enhance inventory management systems to minimize obsolescence.
- Conduct regular asset utilization reviews and dispose of underperforming assets.
- Monitor working capital metrics and optimize procurement and production cycles.

- Conduct annual scenario analysis and stress testing for major risk categories.
- Enhance internal reporting to include segment performance and forward-looking risk assessments.
